  <h1>These are the links from my listicle!</h1>
  <p>They link to the steam pages of my favorite games.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/"target="blank__">Omori</a></li>
    <p>This game is an absolutely phenomenal example of story telling in games, as it relies very heavily <br> on it to be compelling, and it succeeds. This is probably my favorite game of all time and one of <br>only two to have brought tears to my eyes (I do not cry easily). It is one of the few games to hold <br>the prestigious badges of 'Overwhelmingly Positive' on steam with over 50,000 reviews at 97% positive.</p>
    <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1745510/Lunacid/"target="blank__">Lunacid</a></li>
    <p>Lunacid is a Kingsfield (parent series to Dark Souls) inspired, Dark-Fantasy exploration dungeon-crawler. <br>This game will see you wander through dank, bizarre, mystical and spooky underground environments<br> and meet a charming cast of characters.</p>
    <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/"target="blank__">Nine Sols</a></li>
    <p>Nine Sols is an indie game made by Taiwanese studio "RedCandleGames". It is a 2D metroidvania not dissimilar <br>to games like Hollow Knight or Ori and the Will of the Wisps. It has a strong emphasis on <br>combat and an extremely detailed world, lore and story to explore.</p>
    <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/Besiege/"target="blank__">Besiege</a></li>
    <p>Besiege is a physics-based, destructive, puzzle solving sort of game where you build a siege machine with a<br> set of blocks in order to solve problems or destroy something. It recently got a DLC which adds <br>boat's and water mechanics!</p>
    <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/Amnesia_The_Dark_Descent/"target="blank__">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a></li>
    <p>Many people have probably heard of Amnesia, many YouTuber's such as Pewdiepie made let's plays about it back <br>around ~2012, however I'm willing to bet most readers have probably not played the game themselves,<br> which is a real shame. As far as horror games go, this one is fantastic and easily one<br> of the greats!</p>
